# AI-Music-Generator
"AI Music Generator" is a Python program that generates music using deep learning techniques. The program uses a pre-trained neural network model to generate a MIDI file of a new piece of music based on the input style or genre.

Introduction

This project is an AI music generator built with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model is trained on MIDI files and is able to generate new musical sequences based on the learned patterns in the input data.
Getting Started

To use the music generator, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
    Run the app.py script to start the Flask app.
    Load a MIDI file by clicking the "Load MIDI file" button and selecting a file from your computer.
    Choose a sequence length and a temperature for the output sequence.
    Click the "Generate" button to create a new musical sequence.
    Choose an output format (MIDI or MP3) and a name for the output file.
    Click the "Save" button to save the generated sequence to your computer.

Dependencies

This project requires the following Python packages:

    music21
    tensorflow
    Flask
    PyQt5

Usage

The AI music generator can be used to generate new musical sequences based on the input MIDI file. The generated sequences can be saved as MIDI or MP3 files.
